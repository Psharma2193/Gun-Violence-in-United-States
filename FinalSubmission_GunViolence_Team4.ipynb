The data on this website is taken from ATF (United States Department of Justice Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) report on [Firearm Commerce in the United States, 2017 statistics](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/undefined/firearms-commerce-united-states-annual-statistical-update-2017/download) **Exhibit 8** on **National Firearms Act Registered Weapons by State (April 2017)** which lists the number of registered guns by state.\n",

We observed that over the time-period of our analysis (2014-2017), suicides comprise nearly two-thirds of all gun violence related deaths. We also saw that suicides are the leading cause of death from gun violence incidents across all states.\n",

        "\n",
        "This is an important finding becase gun violence related incidents gather public and media attention only when a mass shooting occurs in US. However, in our analysis we found that 70% of deaths due to gun violence incidents are suicides, and they are almost never a part of the public debate. \n",

        "\n",
        "This is an important finding because guns are often advertised and believed to be a means of protection and safety in US, but we clearly see that with increase in gun ownership rates, there is an increase in number of deaths- accidental or suicide. \n",

        "The issue of gun violence is extremely complicated and varied across state laws and local culture. Many states support that strict firearm regulation is a necessary measure in preventing and reducing gun deaths; however, many other states do not take this stance.\n",
        "\n",
        "We could see that states with strict gun policies have fewer instances of suicide deaths when compared to states with lenient gun policies.\n",

However, states can introduce more restrictive laws to help reduce incidents of suicides.\n"
