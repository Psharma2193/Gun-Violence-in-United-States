# Gun-Violence-in-United-States
This is a collaborative project to explore gun violence incidents in US. Gun violence is a highly polarized topic in the United States, with most people already having picked their sides of the debate. 

This project does not aim to satisfy any of those sides. We as a team, who has not been exposed to the issue of gun violence before, intend to present our findings through our own journey of exploration. The visualizations that will be developed are for those individuals, who like us are new to the gun violence debate in US and are free to inform their own opinion on the issue through our narrative.
