# Gun-Violence-in-United-States
This is a collaborative project to explore gun violence incidents in US. Gun violence is a highly polarized topic in the United States, with most people already having picked their sides of the debate. 

This project does not aim to satisfy any of those sides. We as a team of people, who have not been exposed to gun violence, are new to this topic and we intend to present the data through our own journey of exploration. The visualizations that will be developed are for the uninitiated individuals, who like us are new to gun violence debate in US and are free to inform their own opinion on the issue.
